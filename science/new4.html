		<h2>  Synopsis: Splitting the Jets </h2>

		<h3>April 3, 2018</h3>
		<p>  The structure of jets emerging from high-energy collisions of lead ions may provide a new way to study the  <br> quark-gluon plasma created in those same collisions. </p>

		 <p>Physicists collide heavy nuclei to create a quark-gluon plasma (QGP)—a state of matter thought to have filled the  <br>
		 Universe shortly after the big bang. These collisions also produce high-energy quarks and gluons (collectively called  <br>
		 partons) that later form jets of hadrons, such as pions and kaons. A study by the CMS Collaboration at the Large  <br>
		 Hadron Collider indicates that jet measurements may reveal some of the QGP’s effects on the partons, the jet <br>
		 precursors. This approach may lead to a new way to probe the QGP. 
		 </p>

		 <div class="container2">
		 <p>Each of the high-energy partons emerging from the collisions can generate two or more partons through a splitting  <br>
		 process similar to the production of an electron-positron pair from a high-energy photon. While this splitting cannot <br>
		 be directly observed, the researchers set out to demonstrate that jet measurements could indirectly provide  <br>
		 information on the splitting.<br>

		 <p>The team analyzed data from lead-lead and proton-proton collision experiments from 2015. For each experiment, <br>
		 they reconstructed the structure of “subjets” of particles within the jets. From these data, they determined a  <br>
		 parameter that quantifies how the momentum is shared among the partons that participate in a splitting event. The <br>
		 difference between the parton splitting parameters of the lead and the proton cases showed that the parameter <br>
		 depends on the medium in which the partons propagate. And since a QGP is expected to be generated only by lead-<br>
		 lead collisions, the medium-dependent parameter could also reveal QGP effects on partons, which could then be <br>
		 turned around to characterize the QGP.
