		<h2>  Synopsis: Cosmic Instability Could Have Created Dark Matter </h2>

		<h3>March 23, 2018</h3>
		<p>  A proposed instability in the Higgs field could have seeded the Universe with primordial black holes that now  <br> serve as dark matter. </p>

		 <p>Our Universe may be sitting on the edge of destruction, as theory suggests that the Higgs field is in a metastable <br>
		 state. If this field tunneled to its “true” minimum energy state, the release of energy would be cataclysmic. The  <br>
		 danger may be over-stated, as other physical mechanisms could have kept the Universe stable throughout its  <br>
		 history. Nevertheless, the Higgs instability could have a major cosmological impact as the source of dark matter.  <br>
		 According to this new scenario, dark matter consists of a large population of black holes that formed from  <br>
		 fluctuations in the unstable Higgs field at the dawn of the Universe. These so-called primordial black holes have <br>
		 been proposed before, but this is the first hypothesis that doesn’t require physics beyond the standard model.<br>

		 <p>Physicists have long been aware that the Universe might rest in a “false vacuum.” This idea has recently taken on <br>
		 new urgency, as calculations based on the measured Higgs mass have shown that a lower energy state may exist for <br>
		 the Higgs field. Analyzing the implications of the Higgs instability, José Espinosa, from the Catalan Institution for  <br>
		 Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA) in Spain, and David Racco and Antonio Riotto, both at the University of  <br>
		 Geneva, have found that this menacing mechanism could—counterintuitively—be instrumental in creating the dark  <br>
		 matter that makes galaxies and other life-accommodating structures possible. In their calculations, the team <br>
		 explored fluctuations in the Higgs field during an early expansion phase of the Universe, called inflation. Under <br>
		 certain assumptions, these fluctuations become seeds for microscopic black holes with masses around 10^15 kg that <br>
		 could have a density consistent with cosmological predictions of dark matter.<br>
