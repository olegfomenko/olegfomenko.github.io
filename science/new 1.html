		<h2>  Synopsis: Muons for Nuclear Waste Inspection </h2>
		
		</div>
		<h3>April 10, 2018</h3>
		<p>  Muons could be used to check whether spent fuel rods are missing from the casks used to store waste nuclear <br> material. </p>

		 <p>Waste nuclear-fuel rods are typically stored in 3-m-diameter steel casks that hold between 20 and 30 fuel-rod <br>
		 bundles. But once a cask is sealed, there is no way to check how many bundles are inside or, importantly, whether <br>
		 any are missing, without opening it. Now J. Matthew Durham of Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, and <br>
		 colleagues have shown that this problem can be solved by monitoring the paths of cosmic-ray muons passing <br>
		 through a cask. They say that International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors could use the method to verify that <br>
		 nuclear fuel isn’t being diverted from nuclear storage facilities.<br>
		 </p>

		 <div class="container2">
		 <p>The method involves placing muon detectors on opposite sides of a storage cask and tracking the trajectories of <br>
		 muons that pass through the casks. Muons easily penetrate the thick outer layers of the casks, and their trajectories <br>
		 are particularly affected by the presence of heavy elements like plutonium. The team tested their method on a cask <br>
		 housed at Idaho National Laboratory, which contains 24 storage holes for fuel-rod bundles, of which six are empty.<br>
		 </p>

		 <div class="container3">
		 <p>Previous measurements by the team hinted that the muons’ scattering angle was sensitive to missing rods. But the <br>
		 measurements were made on too small an area of the cask to be conclusive. In the new experiments, the team <br>
		 made measurements over the whole cask, placing the detectors in nine different configurations. They confirmed <br>
		 their earlier result and showed that they could pinpoint sections of the cask that had at least two missing fuel <br>
		 bundles. The team says that increasing the measurement time or using larger detectors that catch more muons <br>
		 could make the method sensitive enough to spot a single missing bundle.<br>
